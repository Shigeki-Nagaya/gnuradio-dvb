Gstreamer commands to use with the simple DVB TX/RX. For more tips and tricks see http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/Gstreamer_Cheat_Sheet

Notes:
- video1.ts and video2.ts are named pipes created using the "mkfifo" command.
- The packet encoder adds 12 bytes / packet overhead. Therefore, when USRP rate is set to
  1 Msps, GMSK modulator to 2 samples / symbol and the packet encoder payload size is set to 4000,
  the packet encoder overhead will be 1.5 kbps, leaving 498.5 kbps for the video. Hogher and lower
  rates wil lwork too, tough.
  

1. Launch a video test source encoded to H.264/MPEG-TS and send it to a named pipe called video1.ts:
gst-launch -e videotestsrc ! video/x-raw-yuv, framerate=25/1, width=640, height=360 ! x264enc bitrate=498 ! mpegtsmux ! filesink location=video1.ts

2. Same as above but adds some nice text overlay:
gst-launch -e videotestsrc ! video/x-raw-yuv, framerate=25/1, width=640, height=360 ! timeoverlay halign=left valign=bottom shaded-background=true ! textoverlay text="Test Video 640x360 25fps" halign=center valign=top shaded-background=true ! x264enc bitrate=498 ! mpegtsmux ! filesink location=video1.ts

3. Same as above but uses webcam instead of videotestsrc:
gst-launch -e -v v4l2src device="/dev/video1" ! video/x-raw-yuv, framerate=25/1, width=640, height=360 ! timeoverlay halign=right valign=bottom shaded-background=true ! textoverlay text="Test Video 640x360 25fps" halign=left valign=bottom shaded-background=true ! x264enc bitrate=498 ! mpegtsmux ! filesink location=video1.ts

On the receiver side you can simply run mplayer:
mplayer video2.ts

A Gstreamer based player would look something like this:
gst-launch -v playbin uri=file:///path/to/video2.ts
Unfortunately this does not work with the current setup. I suspect it is due to the mixed CBR/VBR in the setup.


We could also add a local monitor on the TX side; however, this doesn't work on Ubuntu 10.04 but does work on 9.10 (suspecting either x264enc or libx264 regression):
gst-launch -e -v videotestsrc ! video/x-raw-yuv, framerate=25/1, width=640, height=360 ! timeoverlay halign=left valign=bottom shaded-background=true ! textoverlay text="Test Video 640x360 25fps" halign=center valign=top shaded-background=true tee name="splitter" ! queue ! xvimagesink sync=false splitter. ! queue ! x264enc bitrate=498 ! mpegtsmux ! filesink location=video1.ts
