This repository contains simple GNU Radio Companion scripts that I have used for simple DVB setup. It's no DVB-T or DVB-S system (yet), just a simple way to get a webcam on the air.

For video processing I used Gstreamer connected to GNU Radio using named pipes.
See http://wiki.oz9aec.net/index.php/Simple_DVB_with_Gstreamer_and_GNU_Radio for more details.

gmsk_tx.grc and gmsk_rx.grc:
A simple GMSK transmitter and receiver pair that can be used on separate computers and USRPs.

gmsk_trx.grc:
A smiple GMSK transceiver that can be used on one computer with one USRP for both transmit and receive.

gmsk_sim.grc:
A simple TX+RX simulator that can be used to test without any USRP.

gst-cmd.txt:
Example Gstreamer commands to build the video processing pipelines.

multicam.py:
An experimental GUI to switch between different cameras (not very functional yet).
